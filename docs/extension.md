# Browser Extension

The MyPassword browser extension integrates with the desktop app to autofill credentials, copy passwords, and manage vault items directly from the browser.

The official chrome extension can be installed from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mypassword/odemfllimigegcboeohkoijlkooifdip).

## Architecture

The extension communicates with the desktop app over HTTP at `http://127.0.0.1:27432`. The desktop app must be running for the extension to work.

```
Browser Extension                  Desktop App
  popup.js  ──message──>  background.js  ──HTTP──>  HttpDaemon (127.0.0.1:27432)
  content.js                                              │
                                                    RequestController
                                                          │
                                                    VaultManager / DbManager
```

- **popup.js** — UI for unlock, search, autofill actions. Sends messages to the background service worker.
- **background.js** — Service worker that forwards requests to the desktop HTTP server via `fetch`. Handles request signing.
- **content.js** — Injected into web pages to perform credential autofill.

## Pairing

Before the extension can access vault data, it must be paired with the desktop app. Unauthenticated requests (except `POST /pair` and `POST /info`) are rejected with `UNKNOWN_EXTENSION`.

### Pairing flow

1. The extension sends `POST /pair` with `{ name: "MyPassword Chrome Extension", device: "<os> <arch>" }`. The device string is auto-detected via `chrome.runtime.getPlatformInfo()` (e.g. `win x86-64`, `mac arm`).
2. The desktop app saves a pending `ExtensionConfig` record with `approve = false` and a randomly generated shared secret (`seed`).
3. The app returns `{ id, seed }` to the extension, which stores them in `chrome.storage.local`.
4. The app pops up a confirmation dialog asking the user to approve or reject the pairing request.
5. The extension polls `POST /info` and checks whether `data.caller` is non-null, indicating the pairing has been approved.

If the user rejects, the `ExtensionConfig` record is deleted. The extension can retry by sending a new `POST /pair`, which overwrites any previously stored `id` and `seed`.

### Managing extensions

Users can manage paired extensions in **Settings > Extension**:

- **Pending** extensions show **Approve** and **Reject** buttons.
- **Approved** extensions show an **Unpair** button (with confirmation).

Rejecting or unpairing deletes the extension's `ExtensionConfig` from the database, immediately revoking access.

## Request Authentication

Every request from a paired extension (except `/pair`) includes three HTTP headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Extension-Id` | The extension's numeric `id` from pairing |
| `X-Extension-Timestamp` | Current time in milliseconds (`Date.now()`) |
| `X-Extension-Signature` | `HMAC-SHA256(timestamp, seed)` as lowercase hex |

### Server-side validation (`Extension.trySetExtension`)

1. Parse `id`, `timestamp`, and `signature` from the request headers.
2. Look up the `ExtensionConfig` by `id`. Reject if not found or `approve = false`.
3. Check that the timestamp is within 30 seconds of server time (clock skew tolerance).
4. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(timestamp_string, seed_bytes)` and compare against the provided signature.
5. If valid, bind the extension identity to the current thread (`ThreadLocal`) for the duration of the request.

### Unpaired recovery

If the server responds with error `UNKNOWN_EXTENSION`, the extension clears its stored `id` and `seed` from `chrome.storage.local` and returns to the initial pairing screen.

## Security Model

- **Localhost only** — The HTTP server binds to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`. It is not reachable from the network.
- **User-approved pairing** — Every extension must be explicitly approved by the user via a desktop dialog before it can access any vault data.
- **Shared secret** — The `seed` is a random 16-character alphanumeric string generated at pairing time. It never leaves the local machine (stored in the SQLite database on the app side, `chrome.storage.local` on the extension side).
- **HMAC signatures** — Each request is signed with `HMAC-SHA256(timestamp, seed)`. This prevents unauthorized callers on localhost from impersonating a paired extension without knowing the seed.
- **Timestamp validation** — Signatures include a timestamp checked against a 30-second window, preventing replay of captured requests.
- **Vault lock** — Pairing requires the vault to be unlocked. Even after pairing, the extension cannot read vault items while the vault is locked.
- **Revocation** — Unpairing or rejecting an extension deletes its record from the database, immediately invalidating all future requests from that extension.
